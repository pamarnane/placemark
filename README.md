Welcome to PlaceMark

This PlaceMark application is an application that will allow users to store points of interest(POI) to them.

An administrator dashboard is provided that will allow administrators to delete user accounts and add or remove categories for use by users.

The user is able to interact through a Svelte based front-end which can be found at https://github.com/pamarnane/placemark_svelte.

This application now allows this front-end to store user data in a MongoDB through a number of API calls

ToDo List:
- Retire the web interface that is available from the previosu release.
